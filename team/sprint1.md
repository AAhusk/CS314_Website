    * Including returning server identification, showing client identification in header, and showing identification in the browser tab.
    * We will move this to Sprint 2

#### What went well
* Consistent and frequent communication.
* Letting each other know what problems we're encountering.
* Creating time to meet up.

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* Conflicting schedules; solution: have 2 or 3 of us meet up at a time, and catch the others up afterwards. Also, using video chat when we couldn't meet in person.
* Various issues/complications with IntelliJ; solution: coming together with teammates to compare files and build/run results in order to diagnose errors.
