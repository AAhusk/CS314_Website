# Sprint 3 Plan

## Plan for the Sprint

To start your planning, draw a couple of diagrams to guide your discussions and implementation.  This is your basic design which you should update this each sprint.

- [ ] Review the TIP spec to identify changes on your client and server.  Note any deficiencies in your implementation of the previous version. 

- [ ] Draw the client component/screen layout.  Identify all the necessary user interface elements and how they will interact/operate

- [ ] Draw the client component hierarchy, identify where state is located, what props are passed to child components and where state is lifted.  Be as specific as possible.

- [ ] Draw the server class diagram/hierarchy and interactions/sequence for each Restful API service.

## Prepare your Sprint Backlog using Zenhub.

- [ ] Create the Sprint 3 Milestone in Zenhub if you haven't already done so, with a start date of Oct 7 and end date of Oct 24.

- [ ] Groom your sprint backlog, closing finished tasks and Epics if you haven't already. 
- [ ] Assign the Sprint 3 milestone to any unfinished Epics and Tasks from Sprint 2.  Revise the tasks and add new tasks to reflect your understanding of what needs to be accomplished.
- [ ] Add only the Epics from the tripco product backlog you intend to complete in this sprint to your sprint backlog in the team repo, with the appropriate milestone.  Do not just move all of the Epics from tripco and assume you will complete them.
- [ ] Add Tasks associated with the selected Epics to your backlog in the team repo, with appropriate labels and milestone.
- [ ] Add an estimate to each Task using Planning Poker.  Do not put estimates on Epics.
- [ ] Close the Sprint 2 milestone and make sure your burndown chart shows Sprint 3.  All of your epics and tasks should be listed  below the burndown chart if you set their milestone correctly.  This is a one page summary of what you are working on this sprint.  And this is what we grade!

## Create your team/sprint2.md file

- [ ] Identify the Sprint Leader that will own the file for this sprint.

- [ ] Copy the sprint3.md file from the tripco repo.  Note the changes in definition of done and policies that occur each sprint.
- [ ] Complete / revise the following sections with team input:
    - [ ] definition of done (additions only)
    
    - [ ] policies (additions only)
    - [ ] plan should include a discussion, the diagrams you did in preparation, and any other notes that came out of your planning meeting that are not covered by the tasks
    - [ ] metrics should include the number of epics, tasks, and story points in your current plan in the Planned column with comments regarding to address your ability to complete the planned tasks / story points based on your previous sprint velocity.

- [ ] Leave the review, retrospective, and the actual column in the metrics empty for now.  You will update these at the end of the sprint.
