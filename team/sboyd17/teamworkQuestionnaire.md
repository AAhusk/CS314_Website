# Teamwork Questionnaire for _Sean Boyd_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * The best way to reach me is by text. My phone number is 970-412-5013. I am usually awake from 9:00AM - 12:00AM, but feel free to shoot me a text at any time and I will respond back to you ASAP.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * To be honest, I am not sure what to expect this semester so it is hard for me to define my expectations. I expect my team to try our best for each assignment we are given.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * My personal goals for this semester is to try to plan ahead and start assignments early.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * An personal obstical for me is to delegate my time correctly and reasonably. Some other obstacles include communication and organization of the assignments.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I believe that it is important to always try your best no matter what grade you are aiming for. A higher grade is always better than a lower grade. 
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I think the proposed solution would be fair. The people who put in the most effort in the project should definately be recognized for their contributions.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I am a bad estimator at time. I am usually a push through till its done type of person. 5 Hours seams reasonable. I have a feeling it will require more.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * I think that dividing the parts into even sections would be a good start. From there, we could rotate picking orders on each project, or try to delegate tasks based on strengths.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * I will be a little bummed, but life happens. We will need to work on a game plan to not have it happen again. It would be good to have all commits due a day in advance so that we can try to avoid this issue.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * We need to work on a compromise.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Good communication of expectations and deadlines. Im not sure how others work habbits will affect me as long as we set and complete our expectations on time.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * That would be beneficial for the group in my opion. I believe that having meetings keep people involved and informed. In other words, yes, I would like to have meetings outside of class.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I think that once a week is a good start. However, this can be changed as we get a feel for what is needed.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * For bigger decions, approval from every team member should be required. I think that an important aspect of delegating work is that the member should be able to make some decisions for their part themselves. 
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * We need to convince that team member of our point of view. The project can not continue without a consensus from the whole group. The one person needs to make a case why he/she disagrees
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * I will respectfully request that we try to make more team decisions on aspects of the project.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will voice this concern to my group in a respectful manner.
