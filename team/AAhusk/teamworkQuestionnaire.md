# Teamwork Questionnaire for Aaron Huskerson

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   Text me at any time. Email me at anytime. Call me between 4:30 pm and 9:30 pm on weekdays or 9 am and 9 pm on weekends.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   We'll learn how to use git and Javascript while learning to work in a team. We will try our hardest for an A.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   My goal is to learn to work with people's schedules in a cohesive way and plan in a way that accounts for everyone's schedule.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   A busy schedule or conflicting schedules between teammates.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   I always go for A's. I will encourage people to do the best they can even if they want a B, because if you're putting in lower effort
   than you know you can, you're not leaving much room for error. Because something could come around that you actually don't know how to do,
   or you make a big mistake, and you're gonna want some cushion room by having done everything up to that point the best you could've. And then if 
   we plan well and ask questions, we can avoid big mistakes, and therefore have done everything the best we can and we'll get an A. 
   But it's not the end of the world if we don't get an A.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   The team should all put in a very equal amount of work, so no. As long as everyone puts in 
   appropriate effort, it'll be okay. Sometimes assignments are very difficult and you don't get an A on all of them; we should just make sure
   to strive for the A.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   I'm thinking it shouldn't require more than 9 hours per week based off of common CS course expectations. I'm hoping we can do it in around 5 hours per week per person,
   but of course I'll do whatever it takes. I work during the week, but I always have weekends off from work, so I easily have the most free time then.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   Someone will suggest, and the others will vote.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   They get a lower percentage of the grade based off of peer eval's.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   The most critical person explains what they want to the others, and is willing to help others if the others
   are struggling to get to the quality the most critical person wants.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   Tell each other to work earlier if their late working is a hinderance.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   Sure. I'm free Mon, Tue, Thur, Fri after 4:30 pm. Or weekends.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   Once or twice a week maybe.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   Yeah, within a certain timeline.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   Talk about it and come to something everyone agrees upon. I think we're all reasonable.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   Tell them that's what they're doing. Tell them your opinions so that everyone's thoughts are heard.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   Delegate and ask someone to do something. If this question means that this delegation itself is always falling on you, take it as an opportunity to
   be a leader.
